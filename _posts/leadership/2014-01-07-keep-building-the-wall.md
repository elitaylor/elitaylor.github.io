You might be asking yourself, "Why do I care about building walls? I'm not a mason."
True, you may not be a mason. However you've been put on this earth to do something, something great.

<!--more-->

There's a "wall" that you've been called to build and only you can determine what that is.
This wall is the "something great" that you know you need to accomplish this year, but there are
inevitably going to be some distractions. As we strive to accomplish our goals this year and build that wall,
lets take a look at the four enemies that might try to distract you and how to fight them.

## 1.) Good things that aren't the great thing.

There is always something to do isn't there? I'm sure you've been in the break room and heard someone complain: "There just aren't enough hours in a day."
Is this really the problem? Are there not enough hours in a day,
or have we just allowed ourselves to become distracted things that
may be good, but that aren't the great thing that we know we should be doing.
