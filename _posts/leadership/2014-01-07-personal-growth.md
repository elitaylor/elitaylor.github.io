Personal growth is essential for any trying to improve their leadership.

### I think Benjamin Franklin said it best:
> *“When you are finished changing, you're finished.”*

I've been confronted with the absurd idea that personal growth is selfish. The argument goes something like this:
"We should be others oriented, so if you always focus on personal growth then you are selfish...and that's bad."

Here's a few reason why I believe this line of thinking is **#wack.**

<!--more-->


## 1.) You can't give what you don't have:
In order to be selfless you must be giving, but I would like to know exactly how you plan to be giving when you
don't have anything to give. For instance; say I want to give money to a family in need. I must first have the money
to give this family. How am I going to do that? Well personal growth of course! Doesn't it require a
a certain amount of personal growth in order to obtain a job that pays them money? Of course it does, you must first
prove to an employer that you have the skills worthy of a decent salary. Once you've collected a salary, you now have
the means to provide for a family in need. I'm grateful that there are people in the world like you that put such
and emphasis on personal growth. Bless your heart!

## 2.) Personal growth is proof that you serve others:
You show me a person that is growing personally, and I will show you a person who serves others.

In his book [Thou Shall Prosper][tsp], Rabbi Daniel Lapin explains service towards others with a similar illustration:

Suppose you are hungry, and want food. You find a nice restaurant and order your favorite burger, the owner says to you:
"I'll bring that right out for you, but first I will need some proof that you served another human being." You reach
into your wallet and pull out a green piece of paper and say: "Certainly! Here you go, sir!"

>*"You show me a person that is growing personally, and I will show you a person who serves others."*

What have you done here? By serving your employer you have been rewarded with green pieces of paper(money!) that serves as
proof that you have indeed been useful to another human being(in this case your employer).

Look at you! Serving people and making money! You go girl!...or guy!

## 3.) If you don't impove yourself, then you don't have much to offer others.
This life is rough sometimes! The trials that we all face have the power to either break us down or cause us to grow. It's all in how you
choose to respond to it. If you don't heal and grow past your trials, how do intend to help others grow past their trials?

I know this is hard, and I don't want to make light of the hardships that you have faced in your life. 

### I think Matchbox 20 said it best:
> *"I wish the real world, would just stop hassling me"*

But the real world won't stop hassling us. It will continue to present us with very real trials.
You cannot choose whether or not to go through trials, but you can choose how you respond to it.
In order to be a blessing to other people we often need to deal with the pain inside ourselves, it's not healthy to keep all of that inside.
If you don't deal with the baggage in your past, you will bring it into your future and you might just acquire more. If you don't heal and grow
personally, you won't be of much help to other people.

This verse has brought me a lot of comfort over the years:

# In John 16:33 Jesus says:
> I have told you all this so that you may have *peace* in me. Here on earth you *will* have many trials and sorrows. **But take heart, because I have overcome the world.**”

It's okay to be selfish this year. Make sure that you continue to improve yourself. If you continue growing, you will find yourself being very helpful
to others.
