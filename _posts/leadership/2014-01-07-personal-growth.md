Do you remember the last time you were on an airplane? Do you remember the in-flight demonstrations of how to use the oxygen mask in case of an emergency?
They actually instruct you <!--more--> to put your oxygen mask on before you help little children, that way you are
coherent enough to take care of them. Personal growth is like that, you need to continue to grow and change
in order to best server others.


### I think Benjamin Franklin said it best:
> *“When you are finished changing, you're finished.”*

Maybe you've been confronted with the absurd idea that personal growth is selfish. The argument goes something like this:
"We should be others oriented, so if you focus on personal growth then you run the risk of becoming selfish...and that's bad."

Here's a few reason why I believe this line of thinking is **#wack.**

## 1.) You can't give what you don't have:
In order to be selfless you must be giving, but I would like to know exactly how you plan to be giving when you
don't have anything to give. For instance, say I want to give money to a family in need. I must first have the money
to give this family. How am I going to do that? Well personal growth of course! Doesn't it require
a certain amount of personal growth in order to obtain a job that pays me money? Of course it does, I must first
prove to an employer that I have the skills worthy of a decent salary. Once I've collected a salary, I now have
the means to provide for a family in need.

## 2.) Personal growth is proof that you serve others:
You show me a person that is growing personally, and I will show you a person who serves others.

In his book [Thou Shall Prosper][tsp], Rabbi Daniel Lapin explains service towards others with a similar illustration:

Suppose you are hungry, and want food. You find a nice restaurant and order your favorite burger, the owner says to you:
"I'll bring that right out for you, but first I will need some proof that you served another human being." You reach
into your wallet and pull out a green piece of paper and say: "Certainly! Here you go, sir!"

>*"You show me a person that is growing personally, and I will show you a person who serves others."*

What have you done here? By serving your employer you have been rewarded with green pieces of paper(money!) that serve as
proof that you have indeed been useful to another human being(in this case your employer).

Look at you! Serving people and making money! You go girl!...or guy!

## 3.) If you don't improve yourself, then you don't have much to offer others.
This life is rough sometimes! The trials that we all face have the power to either break us down or cause us to grow. It's all about how you
choose to respond to it. If you don't heal and grow past your trials, how do intend to help others grow past their trials?

I know this is hard, and it is not my intent to make light of the hardships that you have faced in your life.

### I think Matchbox 20 said it best:
> *"I wish the real world, would just stop hassling me"*

But the real world won't stop hassling us. It will continue to present us with very real challenges.
You cannot choose whether or not to go through these challenges, but you can choose how you respond to it.
In order to be a blessing to other people we often need to deal with the pain inside ourselves, it's not healthy to keep all of that inside.
If you don't deal with the baggage in your past, you will bring it into your future and you might just acquire more. If you don't heal and grow
personally, you won't be of much help to other people.

This verse has brought me a lot of comfort over the years:

# In John 16:33 Jesus says:
> "I have told you all this so that you may have *peace* in me. Here on earth you *will* have many trials and sorrows. **But take heart, because I have overcome the world.**”

Let me be clear, I am most certainly not saying that it's okay to be selfish. What I'm saying, is that you should seek to grow the gifts that God gave you
so that you can become a blessing, not just so that you can acquire things for yourself. If you are doing all of this for yourself, then please consider the
following passage:

# Proverbs 23:4-5
> 4 Don’t wear yourself out trying to get rich.
    Be wise enough to know when to quit.
  5 In the blink of an eye wealth disappears,
    for it will sprout wings
    and fly away like an eagle.

Things on this earth won't last, and even if they did, you will not. It is very wise to find your purpose in something that will last, if you don't then I think the question we should be asking is:
"Why I am I doing this?" or "What's the purpose of all of my hard work?"

If your motivation for change and growth comes from outside you,
you will be more motivated to grow. You'll always work harder for someone else, and purpose that is bigger than yourself. So despite my controversial title for this post,
my intent is to actually motivate you to grow personally **SO THAT YOU CAN** become a blessing to others. This type of personal growth is not selfish.
